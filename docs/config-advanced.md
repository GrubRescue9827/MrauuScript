# Advanced configuration
There is a very real possibility that I suck so bad at scripting that you can make a better component yourself. So, I've made MrauuScript as modular as possible. Theoretically, you can even use scripts written in languages other than BASH. But I can only mash BASH scripts together, so I can't really test that.

## Custom OS updater scripts
This is by far the simplest script you can make. The only thing this should do is:
* Update the system repository(s).
* Upgrade all packages.

Documentation to be improved.
